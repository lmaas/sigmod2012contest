Current version: 1.03 (released February 10, 2012)

Version history:
  - 1.03 (February 10, 2012)
    * Added Block data type to allow storage of arbitrary payloads
	  * Added ModFlags for DeleteRecord() and UpdateRecord()
    * Added new ErrorCode 'kErrorOpenTransactions' to DeleteIndex()
    * Changed Key to contain the number of key attributes
    * Changed kErrorIncompatibleRecord to kErrorIncompatibleKey
    * GetRecords() no longer needs to return kErrorNotFound
  - 1.02 (December 18, 2011)
    * Clarified requirements for concurrency control
    * Updated documentation for CloseIndex()
    * Clarified how duplicates need to be handled
  - 1.01 (December 17, 2011)
    * Removed scdb namespace to add C support to the interface
    * Updated all transactional functions to expect a pointer to the currently
      running transaction (this removes the dependency on a specific thread
      API like POSIX threads from implementations of this interface)
  - 1.0 Initial release (December 14, 2011)
